# Eye-Friendly Dark Theme Preview

This file describes what the preview image for the Eye-Friendly Dark Theme would look like.

The preview image would show:

1. A VS Code window with the Eye-Friendly Dark Theme applied
2. Multiple code files open showing different programming languages (JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS)
3. The editor would display the warm, muted colors of the theme:
   - Dark gray background (#1E2021) instead of pure black
   - Warm-tinted syntax highlighting colors
   - Reduced contrast between elements
   - Consistent color harmony with earthy tones

4. The UI elements would show:
   - Activity bar with the warm dark color (#252729)
   - Side bar with file explorer (#232527)
   - Editor tabs with active/inactive states
   - Status bar at the bottom
   - Terminal panel open showing the theme colors

This preview would help users visualize how the theme reduces eye strain while maintaining readability and providing a pleasant coding experience for long sessions.

Note: In a real extension, this would be an actual screenshot image (PNG or JPG) showing the theme in action.
